# Data Structures & Algorithms 

This repository contains implementations and learning notes on fundamental data structures and algorithms using C++. The goal is to develop a solid foundation in both theory and practice, with clean and well-documented code suitable for interviews, projects, and deeper CS understanding.

## Contents

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Shell Sort**

### Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

### Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List**
- **Doubly Linked List**
- **Circular Linked List**
- Operations: insertion, deletion, search, reversal

### Stacks and Queues
- **Stack** (array and linked list implementation)
- **Queue** (array and linked list implementation)
- Basic applications and traversal patterns

## Structure

Each topic is organized into its own folder, typically containing:
- Header and implementation files
- Test or demo code (`main.cpp`)

---

## Learning Goals

- Strengthen algorithmic thinking and implementation skills
- Build reusable and clean C++ components
- Gain a deeper understanding of how memory works internally, including data storage, retrieval, and manipulation

---

## Next Topics (Planned)
- Tree structures (Binary Tree, BST)
- Graph algorithms
- Recursion and backtracking
- Advanced sorting (Merge, Quick, Heap)
- Hashing and Dynamic Programming
